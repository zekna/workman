Workman keyboard layouts -- now with added programmer dvorak variants
============================================

While no sane person would use programmer dvorak as a keyboard layout anymore, I've gotten very used to the way the number row and symbols are laid out in it, and rather enjoy it.  I've added layout variants on top of all the official ones that swap the number row and {[ / }] keys in a manner inspired (directly copied) from programmer dvorak.

None of the official layouts are changed at all, so you can use all of them as before.

Workman keyboard layouts
========================

Workman keyboard layout originally proposed by OJ Bucao at http://www.workmanlayout.com.

When learning cold-turkey, trying printing the included keyboard image as a desk reference.

## Important design notes

The original Workman-P proposal by OJ Bucao sought to reverse keys for backtick (`) and brackets ([]), however when considering the Objective-C and PHP programming languages, both make heavy use of the original, primary characters. Swapping them makes those frequent characters more work. **In this repository, only the number keys are reversed** to special characters.

Some of the original key mapping files written by OJ used Colemak positions for alternate/multi/dead key configurations, therefore all the configurations proposed by OJ on his wordpress blog have been modified and bug-fixed in deekayenâ€™s github repository and hosted at http://github.com/deekayen/workman.
